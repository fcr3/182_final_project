# CS 182 Final Project

This repository serves as the codebase for our CS 182 Final Project.

## Instructions

1. It is recommended to start an environment first using virtual env or conda:
```
$ conda create --name final python=3.7
```

2. Install the necessary libraries:
```
$ conda activate final
(final) $ cd rl_project
(final) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Optionally, CUDA can be installed in order to hasten training. This will provide an enhanced experience, but is not necessary.

## Running the Demos

Our project tested a number of different ways to integrate Template Matching into a deep reinforcement learning system. To run these demos, follow the instructions below.
